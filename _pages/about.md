Hi！I am a graduate student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and am about to apply for a Ph.D. Program in 2024. I am now working as a research assistant at [Cardinal Operations](https://www.cardopt.com/). Previously, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Industrial Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University advised by [Prof. Tangbin Xia](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/xiatangbin.html). 

Research Interests
======
My general research area is constraint programming, with an emphasis on production scheduling and unit commitment optimization under production and power system scenarios. I am also interested in operation research, reinforcement learning, renewable energy usage and their interplay.
